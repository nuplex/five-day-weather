#Your Five Day Weather

## About

This is a simple **React** app that displays a five day forecast for a location. You can enter a location, or press a button and 
the app will locate you. That's all!

#### create-react-app
This app was initialized with create-react-app. While create-react-app does come with some boilerplate, it is great for 
quickly starting small applications like this where modification to build folders (e.g. bable, webpack), are not 
necessary. If ever needed, an `npm run eject` allows access to all files and configurations.

## Get Started

#### Live Link
The app is live here:

#### Build & Run Locally
To build and run the app:
1. Clone this repo
2. Ensure you have the latest version of Node and npm installed
3. Open your terminal or shell, navigate to the project directory. In the root directory:
4. Do `npm install`
5. Then `npm run build`
6. Then `npm run start` (or `node server` to run only the `/build` folder)
7. Navigate to `localhost:3000` or `localhost:33278`
8. There's the app! 

If you ran `npm run start`, nodemon is installed and will live-update changes to the project.

To end the program, in your terminal press `CTRL + C`

#### Testing
To run the unit tests, do `npm run test`.

## Features

### Location Input

### Find Based off My Location

#### Enhancement - Autofill Input Bar

This a button that simply gives OWM your lat-long and gives back the weather for
the closest city to you. It would be better to have this fill into the bar. However one we need to be able to resolve
this. This can be done by matching lat-long with the OWM bulk download of cities.

### Custom Weather Icons!

I made the Weather Icons myself! I didn't want to use stock photos, and frankly OWM's icons are a bit dated.

#### Wanted Enhancement - More Icons

There are many different weather conditions grouped under one category or one icon, it would be good to have more 
unique icons for each condition.

#### Wanted Enhancement - SVG Minify

The SVGs could be run through a minifier like SVGOMG, they likely are larger than they need to be.

## Other Wanted Enhancements

### Auto-Complete Location
Auto-complete location input, OWM does not have a direct way to do this, as it does not resolve states (e.g MD, NJ). 
It's implementable if just resolving countries, but this is an app based in the US. One solution I found is to use the
HTML5 getLocation, which return exact lat and long (as long as you're not a vpn), then,using that, send that lat-long 
to the Google Maps API, which can return an appropriate 'guess' to City, State, Country. Another, simpler and faster 
solution would be to store city data that has the lat-long of every city, and autocomplete based off that. OWM's bulk 
has this, but without states, so the user would not be able to differentiate between, e.g. Somerville, NJ and 
Somerville, MA. 

### Accessibility - Icon Alts
The icon alts are very basic and take the group weather pattern, this is most noticed for the 700s (volcanic ash, fog, 
etc.), which defaults to 'fog'. It would be better to make these more distinct.

## Libraries

|library|reason|
|---|---|
|express| The app's server, router to handle REST APIs|
|path| Solely for __dirname which resolves the local directory |
|prop-types| Provides PropTypes to components, helpful for keeping track of props|
|react|The framework used|
|react-dom|Comes with React|
|react-flexbox-grid|Provides easy-to-implement responsiveness|
|react-scripts|Installed by create-react-app|
|request|Used to make  HTTP requests|
|url-parse|Cross-browser way to get queries from a url without writing own regexs|
|nodemon|Live-updates changes to code (react-scripts does this *only* for `/src`)|
|npm-run-all|Allow `npm run start` to start multiple scripts|

## Project Structure
|directory|reason|
|---|---|
|build|Generated by `npm run build` or `node server`, this is what is put on `live` since it is minified.|
|public|Generated by create-react-app, hosts public assets, e.g. `index.html`|
|routes|Keeps API routes out of `server.js`|
|routes/api|Where the APIs actually go|
|src|Contains all code
|src/component|Contains all non-view-like components
|src/component/*|Individual components, optionally bundled with local-only css, a test `spec.js` and any utility functions `util.js`
|src/res|Project resources like css and images|
|src/res/css|CSS that applies to multiple components, or global tags|
|src/res/img|Images and icons|
|src/view|Contains components that are view-like, in that they essentially function as pages. There is only one in this application.
|src/view/*|See `src/component/*`|

I structured the project like this because I find it to be the most logical. It minimizes that shock you get when you open
a directory and there are 100 unorganized files in there, or single files containing too much code. The goal is to keep
relevant parts inside their own directories, e.g. components having their util functions, tests, and CSS in their directory.
For a small project, this level of organization isn't necessary, however it's always goo to keep
scalability of organization in mind.

## Trade-offs

## Known Bugs
- The regular expressions governing the location input likely does not cover all
input scenarios.

## Suspected Bugs
- The OpenWeatherMap calculates the 'five days' based off of 40 three hour periods. It also only starts the periods from
 the current time (e.g. if it is 13:00, the first block of the 40 will be 13:00). It seems that there is a chance that this
 period would overlap six days instead of five.
